    "* Get total number of flights as well as number of flights which are delayed in departure and number of flights delayed in arrival. \n",
    "  * Output should contain 3 columns - **FlightCount**, **DepDelayedCount**, **ArrDelayedCount**\n",
    "* Get number of flights which are delayed in departure and number of flights delayed in arrival for each day along with number of flights departed for each day. \n",
    "  * Output should contain 4 columns - **FlightDate**, **FlightCount**, **DepDelayedCount**, **ArrDelayedCount**\n",
    "  * **FlightDate** should be of **YYYY-MM-dd** format.\n",
    "  * Data should be **sorted** in ascending order by **flightDate**\n",
    "* Get all the flights which are departed late but arrived early (**IsArrDelayed is NO**).\n",
    "  * Output should contain - **FlightCRSDepTime**, **UniqueCarrier**, **FlightNum**, **Origin**, **Dest**, **DepDelay**, **ArrDelay**\n",
    "  * **FlightCRSDepTime** need to be computed using **Year**, **Month**, **DayOfMonth**, **CRSDepTime**\n",
    "  * **FlightCRSDepTime** should be displayed using **YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm** format.\n",
    "  * Output should be sorted by **FlightCRSDepTime** and then by the difference between **DepDelay** and **ArrDelay**\n",
    "  * Also get the count of such flights"
