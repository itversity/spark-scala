    "Let us get the overview of Spark read APIs to read files of different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `spark` has a bunch of APIs to read data from files of different formats.\n",
    "* All APIs are exposed under `spark.read`\n",
    "  * `text` - to read single column data from text files as well as reading each of the whole text file as one record.\n",
    "  * `csv`- to read text files with delimiters. Default is a comma, but we can use other delimiters as well.\n",
    "  * `json` - to read data from JSON files\n",
    "  * `orc` - to read data from ORC files\n",
    "  * `parquet` - to read data from Parquet files.\n",
    "  * We can also read data from other file formats by plugging in and by using `spark.read.format`\n",
    "* We can also pass options based on the file formats.\n",
    "  * `inferSchema` - to infer the data types of the columns based on the data.\n",
    "  * `header` - to use header to get the column names in case of text files.\n",
    "  * `schema` - to explicitly specify the schema.\n",
    "* We can get the help on APIs like `spark.read.csv` using `help(spark.read.csv)`.\n",
    "* Reading delimited data from text files."
