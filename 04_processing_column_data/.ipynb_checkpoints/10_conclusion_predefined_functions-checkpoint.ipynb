    "As part of this module we have gone through list of functions that can be applied on top of columns for row level transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are approximately 300 pre-defined functions.\n",
    "* Functions can be broadly categorized into String Manipulation Functions, Date Manipulation Functions, Numeric Functions etc.\n",
    "* Typically when we read data from source, we get data in the form of strings and we need to apply functions to apply standardization rules, data type conversion, transformation rules etc.\n",
    "* Most of these functions can be used while projection using `select`, `selectExpr`, `withColumn` etc as well as part of `filter` or `where`, `groupBy`, `orderBy` or `sort` etc.\n",
    "* For `selectExpr` we need to use the functions using SQL Style syntax.\n",
    "* There are special functions such as `col` and `lit`. `col` is used to pass column names as column type for some of the functions while `lit` is used to pass literals as values as part of expressions (eg: `concat($\"first_name\", lit(\", \"), $\"last_name\")`)."
